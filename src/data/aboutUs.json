Struggles with anxiety, depression, relationship challenges, addictive behaviors, or surviving trauma and abuse can leave us feeling powerless and discouraged. \n\nAs your counselor, I am committed to providing a safe and supportive environment for healing and growth. We will explore your needs and goals and work together to equip you to change what can be changed, cope with what cannot, and continue building a more fulfilling life.\n\nMy personal and professional code of ethics rests on the conviction that each person has inherent value. Additionally, each of us has the capacity to move beyond the obstacles that have attempted to sabotage our belief in that value and worth. I look forward to walking alongside you during this process.\n\n",
