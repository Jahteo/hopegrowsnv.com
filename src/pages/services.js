              <p>Group Therapy at this time is focused on helping clients with Anger Management challenges learn new and healthy ways to manage their anger. Our group curriculum is an evidence-based intervention endorsed by SAMSHA, the national clearing house for evidence-based practices for mental health and substance abuse treatment. The group consists of two individual sessions with a provider who provides assessment and treatment planning services, followed by 12-1 hour group sessions focused on skill building to aid clients in understanding and managing their anger.</p>
